The name **SUM** does not indicate mathematical operation of addition. It's just an abbreviation - **S**top **U**sing **M**ouse!  ... at least for calculations.

SUM is an easy to use yet powerful and intuitive cross-platform "one-line" calculator with History. It's designed for full-size keyboards with numeric keypad - to pop up and close with NumLock key and turn so the numeric keypad to calculator. However you can change the key binding in settings and use it with any keyboard.
